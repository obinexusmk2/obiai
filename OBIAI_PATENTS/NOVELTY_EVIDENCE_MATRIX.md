# OBIAI Novelty Evidence Matrix

## How to review
1. For each claim row, open the **exact claim text source path** first and verify the wording is reproduced exactly in this matrix.
2. Validate novelty scope by checking the **"What is new"** sentence and its one-sentence boundary against the linked internal evidence.
3. Confirm implementation traceability by opening all three internal evidence anchors: **PDF section**, **Markdown section**, and **transcript snippet path**.
4. For prior-art analysis, fill the placeholder fields (citation ID, overlap rating, differentiation note) with independent reviewer findings before legal submission.
5. Reproducibility is only complete when code, pseudocode/spec, and benchmark artifacts all resolve to concrete repository paths.

| Claim ID | Exact claim text + source path | What is new (with one-sentence scope boundary) | Internal evidence links (PDF section, markdown section, transcript snippet path) | External prior-art comparison (placeholder) | Reproducibility artifacts (code path, pseudocode path, benchmark artifact path) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-XYZ-01 | **"defining an ontological coordinate system with three axes: X-axis ... Y-axis ... Z-axis ..."** (`OBIAI_PATENTS/obiai_patent_claims.md`, Claim 1(a)); supporting terminology: **"Ontological Agent (XYZ Self-Location)"** (`OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` §10.1). | New contribution: explicit XYZ self-location is treated as a first-class inference state variable instead of an implicit model latent. **Scope boundary:** this claim is limited to coordinate declaration and state logging, not to any specific downstream classifier architecture. | PDF: `OBIAI_PATENTS/Ontological Bayesian Intelligence Architecture.pdf` (sections on coordinate-conscious reasoning).<br>Markdown: `OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` (§10.1 Ontological Agent).<br>Transcript: `TRANSCRIPTS/TRANSCRIPT/GEOCALL 18 NOV/gocall 2_otter_ai.txt` (snippet mentioning "X, Y, Z continuous"). | Citation ID: `TBD`<br>Overlap rating (0-1): `TBD`<br>Differentiation note: `TBD` | Code: `OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` (`# obiai/ontology.py` block).<br>Pseudocode/spec: `OBIAI_PATENTS/obiai_patent_claims.md` (Claim 1 structure).<br>Benchmark artifact: `OBIAI_PATENTS/README.md` (evaluation/threshold references). |
| C-TRI-02 | **Trident probe consensus mechanism** (topology and 2/3 consensus rule): `nsigii_lte_codec/5-NSIGII_Probe_System/probe.py` (`compute_trident_consensus`, Trident packet flow). | New contribution: tri-channel probe verification (Transmitter/Receiver/Verifier) binds message validity to topology-level consensus rather than a single channel verdict. **Scope boundary:** this claim is constrained to trident consensus protocol behavior and does not claim all multi-party consensus systems generally. | PDF: `OBIAI_PATENTS/Unified_Quantum_Classical_Bridge_Protocol__UQCBP_.pdf` (interoperability/consensus context).<br>Markdown: `nsigii_lte_codec/5-NSIGII_Probe_System/templates/index.html` (Trident API and topology documentation blocks).<br>Transcript: `TRANSCRIPTS/Fitler and Flash Interdepe CISCO Se.txt` (snippets naming "trident message"). | Citation ID: `TBD`<br>Overlap rating (0-1): `TBD`<br>Differentiation note: `TBD` | Code: `nsigii_lte_codec/5-NSIGII_Probe_System/probe.py`, `.../server.py`.<br>Pseudocode/spec: `nsigii_lte_codec/5-NSIGII_Probe_System/templates/index.html` (protocol narrative).<br>Benchmark artifact: `TBD - add trident consensus test report path`. |
| C-FF-03 | **"Operational Consciousness Metric falls below 0.954"** (`OBIAI_PATENTS/obiai_patent_claims.md`, Claim 12(d)); **"Epistemic Confidence: Maintains >= 95.4% threshold"** (`OBIAI_PATENTS/README.md`). | New contribution: Filter-Flash style safety gating tied to a quantified 95.4% epistemic threshold for mode control and deployment readiness. **Scope boundary:** the novelty is the threshold-gated decision policy, not a claim that 95.4% is universally optimal across all domains. | PDF: `OBIAI_PATENTS/OBIAI_Filter_Flash_DAG_Cognition_Engine_v2_2.pdf` (Filter-Flash DAG mechanism).<br>Markdown: `OBIAI_PATENTS/README.md` (95.4% threshold and engine references).<br>Transcript: `TRANSCRIPTS/TRANSCRIPT/GEOCALL 18 NOV/gocall 2_otter_ai.txt` (filter system performance discussion). | Citation ID: `TBD`<br>Overlap rating (0-1): `TBD`<br>Differentiation note: `TBD` | Code: `OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` (`update_mode`, `compute_ocm`).<br>Pseudocode/spec: `OBIAI_PATENTS/README.md` (Filter-Flash and OCM narrative).<br>Benchmark artifact: `OBIAI_PATENTS/The 95.4 Metrc.pdf`. |
| C-ISO-04 | **"performing isomorphic handshake validation between data and algorithm signatures"** (`OBIAI_PATENTS/obiai_patent_claims.md`, Claim 6(b)); reference implementation: `isomorphic_handshake(...)` (`OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` §10.3). | New contribution: runtime integrity uses data-signature/algo-signature isomorphism as a hard inference gate with fail-closed behavior. **Scope boundary:** this claim covers handshake-gated integrity checks and auditability, not every cryptographic signature scheme. | PDF: `OBIAI_PATENTS/Isomorphic_Reduction__Not_a_Bug__But_a_Feature.pdf` (isomorphism framing).<br>Markdown: `OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` (§10.3 Infrastructure Handshake).<br>Transcript: `TRANSCRIPTS/TRANSCRIPT/GEOCALL 18 NOV/Geo Call_otter_ai.txt` (isomorphic substrate discussion). | Citation ID: `TBD`<br>Overlap rating (0-1): `TBD`<br>Differentiation note: `TBD` | Code: `OBIAI_PATENTS/SECTION_10.md` (`# obiai/infrastructure.py` block).<br>Pseudocode/spec: `OBIAI_PATENTS/obiai_patent_claims.md` (Claims 5(e), 6(a-d)).<br>Benchmark artifact: `TBD - add handshake failure-rate evaluation path`. |
