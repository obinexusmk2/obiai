# Use It, Respect It

## **Constructive Use and Contribution Clause**

> ### OBINexus Open Access Projects

> **Our Vision:**  
> OBINexus Open Access projects are shared in the spirit of collective growth, innovation, and ethical technology. This work is open not just for use, but for **collaborative improvement**.

> **Who We Welcome:**  
> Developers, designers, researchers, and learners who **see value in contributing**, not just consuming. If you're here to build, test, question, improve, or explore — you're in the right place.

> **Important Note:**  
> If your engagement is limited to **complaining about missing features**, demanding rapid updates without support, or expecting a self-debugging ecosystem with no input — this may not be the space for you.

> **Understanding Open Access:**  
> Open access doesn't mean infinite resources. We are a community of humans, not an on-demand service. Projects grow when people **collaborate, not when they just consume**.

> **Your Role:**  
> If you're using this resource and notice something missing or broken — **that's your invitation to help**, not a reason to dismiss the work.

> **Our Philosophy:**  
> Let's keep OBINexus moving forward — with people who build, not just break.
